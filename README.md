### Interact with my website!
I have uploaded a version of this code to a free hosting service so that you can access my website! <br>
Link: <a href= "http://erdyn.000.pe">Here</a>

## Description:
This website is for a library, it connects to a db with tables: users, books, reservations, categories. <br>
<details>
<summary>Requirements: </summary>
<ul>
<li>User cannot access the system if not logged in</li>
<li>User can reserve books</li>
<li>User can view their reservations</li>
<li>User can unreserve a book</li>
<li>User cannot reserve books that are already reserved</li>
</ul>
</details> <br>
This website demonstrates my ability to implement sessions and interact with a database, including performing operations on its tables.
